name: ticket-generator
description: Generates a ticket (title + description, markdown only) from an engineering tripack, a raw report/finding doc, or directly from actual code changes (diff/branch compare) when no docs exist. Use this at the END of implementation work, right before pushing to a branch, or retroactively when work was already committed/pushed but no ticket was ever written. Always use when the user asks to "buat tiket", "generate ticket", "write a ticket for this change", or wants a ticket/task description derived from a tripack, a finding (e.g. dependency upgrade, SonarQube finding), or a diff/branch comparison. Do NOT use this for pre-work planning tickets (that's engineering-tripack-generator's task-plan) — this skill documents what was actually done or is actually changing.

# Ticket Generator

Produces a single ticket — **title + description, in markdown only** — that accurately reflects what was actually changed, not just what was planned. It runs post-implementation (or retroactively after a commit/push), so the source of truth is the real diff, with docs (tripack/finding) as supporting context.

## Step 0 — Required Input Gate (validate before doing anything else)

Do NOT ask the user interactively mid-run. Instead, inspect what was given in the invocation prompt, determine the scenario below, and if a required input for that scenario is missing, STOP immediately and tell the user exactly what's missing. Never guess a default (e.g. never assume `main` as base_branch).

**Inputs Claude looks for in the prompt:**
- `doc_path` — path to a tripack (technical-design/tactical-strategy/task-plan) or a raw report/finding doc. Optional depending on scenario.
- `base_branch` — a branch name to diff against (e.g. `main`, `develop`). If present, it is the **dominant signal** — see Scenario Detection.
- `output_language` — **REQUIRED, always.** Must be either `en` (English) or `id` (Indonesian/Bahasa Indonesia). If not specified anywhere in the prompt, STOP and ask the user which language they want before generating anything. This determines the language of the generated title + description (this SKILL.md itself always stays in English — only the *output* changes).

## Step 1 — Scenario Detection

Check in this priority order:

1. **`base_branch` given explicitly?** → **Scenario 3 (Retroactive / Branch Compare)**, regardless of whether `doc_path` is also given. If `doc_path` is present, treat it as *additional context only* — not the authoritative source of Goal/Scope. Diff source: `git diff base_branch...HEAD` (or the equivalent comparison against the current branch).
2. **No `base_branch`, but `doc_path` given AND the working tree has uncommitted/staged changes?** → **Scenario 2 (Docs + Diff)**. Diff source: working tree / staged diff. Implementation is done but not yet pushed.
3. **No `base_branch`, `doc_path` given, working tree is clean (no diff)?** → **Scenario 1 (Docs-only)**. No diff exists yet — ticket is generated purely from the doc. (Note: this is the pre-work case; confirm with the user this is intentional, since the skill's main use case is post-implementation.)
4. **None of the above clearly holds** → STOP. Ask the user to clarify which scenario applies (they've likely forgotten to pass `doc_path` or `base_branch`).

| Scenario | Required | Optional | Diff source |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 — Docs-only | `doc_path`, `output_language` | — | none |
| 2 — Docs + Diff | `doc_path`, `output_language` | — | working tree / staged |
| 3 — Retroactive | `base_branch`, `output_language` | `doc_path` (context only) | `git diff base_branch...HEAD` |

## Step 2 — Gather the Real Change

- For Scenario 2/3: read the actual diff. Identify every file/function touched.
- Cross-reference touched files/functions against flow docs (from `flow-scanner`, if available in the repo) to determine which business flow(s) are impacted. Don't rely on file paths alone if a flow doc exists — it gives the authoritative file→flow mapping.
- If `doc_path` is also present, compare the *planned* scope (In Scope/Out of Scope from tripack) against what the diff *actually* touches. If there's a mismatch (diff touches something tripack marked Out of Scope, or vice versa), surface this explicitly in the description rather than silently trusting the doc.

## Step 3 — QA Impact Gate (conditional, not automatic)

QA Impact is **optional in every scenario** — including Scenario 1/2 with a tripack. Do not force it in and do not force it out; decide per case:

- Does the diff touch anything with **observable behavior** (API response, UI, user-facing flow, business logic)? → Include the QA Impact table.
- Is the diff purely internal (refactor with no contract change, comment/formatting, dependency bump with no breaking API change, internal renames)? → Skip the QA Impact section entirely. Add one line in the Description instead: *"No QA impact — internal change, no observable behavior change."*
- If genuinely ambiguous, default to **including** QA Impact rather than skipping it — a table that turns out to be light-touch costs less than a missed regression.

**QA Impact table format (always this table, never bullets):**

| No | Area | Yang dicek | Expected |
|----|------|-----------|----------|
| 1  | ...  | ...       | ...      |

- **Area**: the module/flow/endpoint actually touched (from Step 2's flow mapping).
- **Yang dicek**: the specific scenario to verify — prioritize edge cases exposed by the change (new-user path, old-data path, empty/zero cases), not just the happy path.
- **Expected**: the expected outcome per Acceptance Criteria — each AC can usually be split into 1+ regression rows.
- If the diff is something like a dependency upgrade with no direct behavior change but still warrants a smoke check, one row is enough (e.g. Area = service name, Yang dicek = "smoke test after upgrade", Expected = "no errors, behavior unchanged").

## Step 4 — Generate the Ticket

Output format — **markdown only**, title + description, written entirely in `output_language`:

```markdown
# [TYPE] Title

## Description
2–3 sentences: what changed and why. TYPE is one of FEATURE / BUGFIX / REFACTOR / CHORE.

## Goal
One outcome-oriented sentence.

## In Scope
- ...

## Out of Scope
- ...
(If Step 2 found a mismatch between planned and actual scope, note it here explicitly.)

## QA Impact
(Omit this whole section if Step 3 determined there's no QA impact — replace with the one-line note in Description instead.)

| No | Area | Yang dicek | Expected |
|----|------|-----------|----------|
| 1  | ...  | ...       | ...      |

## Acceptance Criteria
- ...

## Related
- Links/paths to doc_path, flow doc, delta report, task-plan, or the compared branch — whatever was actually used as input.
```

Notes on generation:
- **Title**: concise, action-oriented, prefixed with the TYPE tag.
- Do not include a "Progress" / done-vs-todo checklist section — this skill runs after work is finished (or retroactively), so there's no pending-work state to report. If the user explicitly says some planned tasks were deferred/skipped, mention that under Out of Scope, not as a separate section.
- For Scenario 3 with no `doc_path`, Goal/In Scope/Out of Scope are **reconstructed from the diff and commit history**, not verified against an original intent. Say so plainly, e.g. (in the output language): *"Goal & scope reconstructed from commit history — not verified against original intent, please review."*

- This skill is meant to run right before push — it does not modify code, branches, or commits. It only reads and reports.
